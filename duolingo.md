## iphone version
advantage: portable, as long as you have a data plan
most people have phones
small amount of time to finish a 'lesson'
practice every day doesn't feel overwhelming
can couple with another activity like walking the dog

disadvantage: have to be connected to the internet (non free version claims to allow offline learning)
people don't leave 
ads are your time (you are the product)

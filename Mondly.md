## what I like
tells you how many words and phrases are in a lesson, and the estimated time to complete

## what I don't like
handsfree is attempting to simulate a human interraction.  there is far more english text on the screen than the 9 phrases you are learning from the lesson.  not much immersion or learning here

## time it takes
regular lesson (swipe, drag, etc)
start time: 8:43:46
screens: 20
end time: 8:46:58
total time: ~ 3:12
review time (doesn't seem optional):
start time: 8:47:03
end time: 8:47:42
total time: 40 seconds

handsfree lesson
start: 8:48
end: 8:53:01
total time: ~5 min
